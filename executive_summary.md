## Objective
The objective of this project was to:
- Automatically classify customer reviews by sentiment
- Handle large-scale, unstructured text data efficiently
- Deliver interpretable and actionable insights using a practical machine learning approach

---

## Approach
- Downloaded and parsed a large-scale public dataset of Amazon reviews
- Used TF-IDF to convert text into numerical features
- Trained a Logistic Regression classifier for sentiment prediction
- Evaluated model performance using standard classification metrics

A representative subset of the dataset was used to ensure fast execution while maintaining reliable results.

---

## Key Findings
- The model achieved approximately **87% accuracy** on unseen test data
- Performance was balanced across both positive and negative sentiment classes
- Traditional machine learning methods proved effective for large-scale sentiment classification

---

## Business Impact
This solution enables organizations to:
- Monitor customer sentiment automatically
- Identify trends in customer satisfaction
- Support data-driven product and marketing decisions
- Scale sentiment analysis without heavy computational resources
